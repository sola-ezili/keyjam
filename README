Keyjam. Turns your PC keyboard into a MIDI sampler pad.

Written in Perl 5.

Dependencies:
perlqt4 (QtCore4, QtGui4)
MIDI::ALSA (try force install through cpan if test #35 fails - it's okay :)

This is simply a MIDI instrument. It does not synthesize sound on its own. You will need to install a software synthesizer or use a hardware synthesizer with the necessary MIDI interfaces to make it work. Right now Keyjam uses only ALSA for MIDI connections. JACK is optional but highly recommended.
